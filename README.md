A researcher in Software Process Improvement and Appraisal. 

I create [compliance_checker](https://github.com/roongsangjan/compliance_checker), [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) plugin, to implement the new measurements for software process improvement and appraisal. 

This work will be published in [Journal of Software: Evolution and Process](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20477481).

These new measurements help internal and external auditor
* to evaluate a process model against a process reference model before a deployment process
* to monitor software development team to follow the deployed process model
* to assess a process implementation readiness against a process reference model before an official appraisal process
